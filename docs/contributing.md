## Tickets and Issues

We use Github, Trello and Slack. Github is for reporting bugs and useability issues. Slack is for discussion and collaboration, and more regular updates. We use Trello for broader functionality planning and ticket tracking. 

If you're using the site and see bugs, usability issues, or have suggestions,
use [github issues](https://github.com/jessykate/modernomad/issues?state=open) to submit them. Developers will get a notification, we can discuss the
issue or idea, and then turn that into an implementation plan. 

We use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/FPDnTkqj/modernomad) for
our broader planning, discussions, and tracking who is working on what. There's
design- documentation- and development-related tickets there, so plenty to
help out with if you are inclined. To make it easier to hook into the process,
there are a few specific labels worth explaining: 

* **Quick/Easy**: should be relatively simple to do. Good for new programmers,
  or people just getting farmiliar with the code base. 
* **Feature**: if you want the satisfaction of implementing something
  that will expose new functionality to users, look at these. They are generally
  more work and involve some combination of models, logic and frontend. 
* **Problem/Bug**: these tickets are a good way to get oriented with the codebase,
  usually because they involve looking through a lot of code in order to find
  specific lines that touch a specific field or model. They can be simple or
  more advanced. 

## General process for making contributions

1. Say hello! We're super friendly and we love contributions :). Comment on a github issue or request access to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/FPDnTkqj/modernomad) or Slack by contacting [jessy](mailto:jessy@embassynetwork.com).  
1. Get your dev environment set-up (see [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md) and [How to Run](how-to-run.md)).
1. Choose a [ticket](https://trello.com/b/FPDnTkqj/modernomad) of interest and let us know you're working on it. 
1. [Fork the code](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
1. Create a [new branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) for the work you're doing. 
1. Make your mods! If you want to chat with us about any ideas or your approach, then come join us on Slack to discuss.  
1. Commit your changes and push them back to your repository. ([basic overview of commands](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo))
1. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) back to the origin repository.
